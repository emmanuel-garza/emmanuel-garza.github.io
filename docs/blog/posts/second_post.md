# Test blog

__You enjoy working with Material for MkDocs? Share the love! You can now add
a badge to your project's README, showing that your project is built with
Material for MkDocs.__

Material for MkDocs' logo was just added to [Simple Icons], which is used by
[Shields.io] to include logos in badges. We generated a badge for you, which
you can add to your project's README:

<!-- [![Material for MkDocs][badge]](#usage) -->

<!-- more -->

## Usage

Just copy the following snippet and paste it into your project's `README.md`:

``` markdown
[![Built with Material for MkDocs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Material_for_MkDocs-526CFE?style=for-the-badge&logo=MaterialForMkDocs&logoColor=white)](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
```

```cpp title="test.cpp"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
    return 0; // (1)
}
```

1.  :man_raising_hand: I'm a code annotation! I can contain `code`, __formatted
    text__, images, ... basically anything that can be written in Markdown.
